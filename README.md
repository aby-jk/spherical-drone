This paper demonstrates a working configuration for a single propeller spherical multiterrain aerial vehicle designed primarily for search and rescue operations and military applications. The drone is housed inside a carbon-fiber 2-v geodesic sphere, making
it collision tolerant and allowing it to land anywhere
without the need for extensive pilot training. The inner
and outer rings constitute a gimbal mechanism which is
decoupled from the motor and electronics embedded on
the central frame. This allows the drone to remain stable
after experiencing collisions. The drone is stabilized
using an MPU 6050 6 DOF IMU sensor coupled to an
Arduino flight controller and servo motors that actuate
the control vanes to achieve the desired attitude control.
We also discuss the possible applications such as in the
military, constrained space surveillance, search & rescue
and in pipeline inspection to detect gas leakage.
